This paradigm is evolving to include other sources of information, such as known relations between samples. Here, we show that, even if additional relational information is not available in the dataset, one can improve classification by constructing geometric graphs from the features themselves, and using them within a Graph Convolutional Network. The improvement in classification accuracy is maximized by graphs that capture sample similarity with relatively low edge density. We show that such feature-derived graphs increase the alignment of the data to the ground truth while improving class separation. We also demonstrate that the graphs can be made more efficient using spectral sparsification, which reduces the number of edges while still improving classification performance. We illustrate our findings using synthetic and real-world datasets from various scientific domains.","tags":[],"title":"Geometric graphs from data to aid classification tasks with graph convolutional networks","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Yifan Qian","Paul Expert","Tom Rieu","Pietro Panzarasa","Mauricio Barahona"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1610323200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1610323200,"objectID":"05e854eadb2359f064fc6057062ddda4","permalink":"https://yifanqian.com/publication/qian-2021-quantifying/","publishdate":"2020-11-26T17:43:20Z","relpermalink":"/publication/qian-2021-quantifying/","section":"publication","summary":"We show that the classification performance of Graph Convolutional Networks is related to the alignment between features, graph and ground truth, which we quantify using a subspace alignment measure corresponding to the Frobenius norm of the matrix of pairwise chordal distances between three subspaces associated with features, graph and ground truth. The proposed measure is based on the principal angles between subspaces and has both spectral and geometrical interpretations. We showcase the relationship between the subspace alignment measure and the classification performance through the study of limiting cases of Graph Convolutional Networks as well as systematic randomizations of both features and graph structure applied to a constructive example and several examples of citation networks of different origin. The analysis also reveals the relative importance of the graph and features for classification purposes.","tags":[],"title":"Quantifying the alignment of graph and features in deep learning","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Yifan Qian","Wenge Rong","Nan Jiang","Jie Tang","Zhang Xiong"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1488326400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1488326400,"objectID":"7098522c219eb59133ea3d89276a4f28","permalink":"https://yifanqian.com/publication/qian-2017-citation/","publishdate":"2020-11-26T17:57:25Z","relpermalink":"/publication/qian-2017-citation/","section":"publication","summary":"A number of bibliometric studies point out that the role of conference publications in computer science differs from that in other traditional fields. Thus, it is interesting to identify the relative status of journal and conference publications in different subfields of computer science based on the citation rates categorised by the China Computer Federation (CCF) classifications and venue types. In this research, we construct a dataset containing over 100,000 papers recommended by the CCF catalogue and their citation information. We also investigate some other factors that often influence a paperâ€™s citation rate. An experimental study shows that the relative status of journals and conferences varies greatly in different subfields of computer science, and the impact of different publication levels varies according to the citation rate. We also verify that the classification of a publication, number of authors, maximum h-index of all authors of a paper, and average number of papers published by a publication have different effects on the citation rate, although the citation rate may have a different degree of correlation with these factors.","tags":[],"title":"Citation regression analysis of computer science publications in different ranking categories and subfields","type":"publication"}]
