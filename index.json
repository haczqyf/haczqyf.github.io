The proposed measure is based on the principal angles between subspaces and has both spectral and geometrical interpretations. We showcase the relationship between the subspace alignment measure and the classification performance through the study of limiting cases of Graph Convolutional Networks as well as systematic randomizations of both features and graph structure applied to a constructive example and several examples of citation networks of different origin. The analysis also reveals the relative importance of the graph and features for classification purposes.","tags":[],"title":"Quantifying the alignment of graph and features in deep learning (forthcoming)","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Yifan Qian","Paul Expert","Pietro Panzarasa","Mauricio Barahona"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1588896000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1588896000,"objectID":"6656bc50127e5342ff3f3dcaa5169e43","permalink":"https://yifanqian.com/publication/qian-2020-geometric/","publishdate":"2020-11-26T18:01:15Z","relpermalink":"/publication/qian-2020-geometric/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Geometric graphs from data to aid classification tasks with graph convolutional networks","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Yifan Qian","Wenge Rong","Nan Jiang","Jie Tang","Zhang Xiong"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1488326400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1488326400,"objectID":"7098522c219eb59133ea3d89276a4f28","permalink":"https://yifanqian.com/publication/qian-2017-citation/","publishdate":"2020-11-26T17:57:25Z","relpermalink":"/publication/qian-2017-citation/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Citation regression analysis of computer science publications in different ranking categories and subfields","type":"publication"}]
