Conceptually, tenure systems may act as a selection mechanism, screening in high-output researchers; a dynamic incentive mechanism, encouraging high output prior to tenure but low output after tenure; and a creative search mechanism, encouraging tenured individuals to undertake high-risk work. Here, we integrate data from seven different sources to trace US tenure-line faculty and their research outputs at an unprecedented scale and scope, covering over 12,000 researchers across 15 disciplines. Our analysis reveals that faculty publication rates typically increase sharply during the tenure track and peak just before obtaining tenure. Post-tenure trends, however, vary across disciplines: in lab-based fields, such as biology and chemistry, research output typically remains high post-tenure, whereas in non-lab-based fields, such as mathematics and sociology, research output typically declines substantially post-tenure. Turning to creative search, faculty increasingly produce novel, high-risk research after securing tenure. However, this shift toward novelty and risk-taking comes with a decline in impact, with post-tenure research yielding fewer highly cited papers. Comparing outcomes across common career ages but different tenure years or comparing research trajectories in tenure-based and non-tenure-based research settings underscores that breaks in the research trajectories are sharply tied to the individual's tenure year. Overall, these findings provide a new empirical basis for understanding the tenure system, individual research trajectories, and the shape of scientific output.","tags":[],"title":"Tenure and Research Trajectories","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Yifang Wang","Yifan Qian","Xiaoyu Qi","Nan Cao","Dashun Wang"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1689379200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1689379200,"objectID":"3bed777e5d931fa33432b931ae545eaa","permalink":"https://yifanqian.com/publication/wang-2023-innovationinsights/","publishdate":"2020-11-26T17:43:20Z","relpermalink":"/publication/wang-2023-innovationinsights/","section":"publication","summary":"Science has long been viewed as a key driver for economic growth and rising standards of living. Knowledge about how scientific advances support marketplace inventions is therefore essential for understanding the role of science in propelling real-world applications and technological progress. The increasing availability of large-scale datasets tracing scientific publications and patented inventions and the complex interactions among them offers us new opportunities to explore the evolving dual frontiers of science and technology at an unprecedented level of scale and detail. Yet we lack suitable visual analytics approaches to effectively analyze such complex interactions. Here we introduce InnovationInsights, an interactive visual analysis system for researchers, research institutions, and policymakers to explore the complex linkages between science and technology, and identify critical innovations, inventors, and potential partners. The system first identifies important associations between scientific papers and patented inventions through a set of statistical measures introduced by our experts from the field of Science of Science. A series of visualization views are then used to present these associations in the data context. In particular, we introduce the Interplay Graph to visualize patterns and insights derived from the data, helping users effectively navigate citation relationships between papers and patents. It thereby helps them identify the origins of technical inventions and the impact of scientific research. We evaluate the system through two case studies with experts followed by expert interviews. We further engage a premier research institution to test-run the system, helping its institution leaders to extract new insights for innovation. Through both case studies and the engagement project, we find that our system not only fulfills our original purposes of design, allowing users to better identify the sources of technical inventions and understand the broad impact of scientific research; it also enables an array of new applications for researchers and research institutions, ranging from identifying untapped innovation potentials within an institution to forging new collaboration opportunities between science and industry.","tags":[],"title":"InnovationInsights: A Visual Analytics Approach for Understanding the Dual Frontiers between Science and Technology","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Yifan Qian"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1632787200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1632787200,"objectID":"eaa0aac05ab32ba19b74e0592730a2fe","permalink":"https://yifanqian.com/publication/qian-2021-network/","publishdate":"2020-11-26T17:43:20Z","relpermalink":"/publication/qian-2021-network/","section":"publication","summary":"Over the last few decades, networks have played an increasingly important role in multiple scientific domains, ranging from social science to physics and computer science. This thesis mainly focuses on three types of networks (citation networks, social networks, and collaboration networks) by combining theories and methods from network science, sociology, machine learning, and data science. Specifically, I present four projects concerned with two research clusters: social capital and deep learning. In the first project, I develop new measures of network effective size, i.e., intra- and inter-brokerage based on non-topological properties of nodes in directed and weighted networks, which can provide finer-grained perspectives on social capital. In the second project, I explore the social capital of cities extracted from the collaboration patterns of their resident scientists and their external collaborators by combining four large-scale bibliometric data sets. Results suggest that the relationship between the (internal or external) brokerage and scientific performance of cities is moderated by internal or external strong ties and the cities’ geographical diversity. In the third project, I show that the classification performance of Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) is related to the alignment among features, graph, and ground truth, which I quantify using a subspace alignment measure corresponding to the Frobenius norm of the matrix of pairwise chordal distances between three subspaces associated with the three ingredients. The proposed measure is based on the principal angles between subspaces and has both spectral and geometrical interpretations. In the fourth project, I show that, if additional relational information is not available in the data set, one can improve classification by constructing geometric graphs from the features themselves and using them within a GCN. I also show that such feature-derived graphs increase the alignment of the data to the ground truth while improving class separation.","tags":[],"title":"Network science, big data analytics, and deep learning: An interdisciplinary approach to the study of citation, social and collaboration networks","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Yifan Qian","Paul Expert","Pietro Panzarasa","Mauricio Barahona"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1617926400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1617926400,"objectID":"71bf2537e2a44cfe05519c3da07c56d0","permalink":"https://yifanqian.com/publication/qian-2021-geometric/","publishdate":"2020-11-26T18:01:15Z","relpermalink":"/publication/qian-2021-geometric/","section":"publication","summary":"Traditional classification tasks learn to assign samples to given classes based solely on sample features. This paradigm is evolving to include other sources of information, such as known relations between samples. Here, we show that, even if additional relational information is not available in the dataset, one can improve classification by constructing geometric graphs from the features themselves, and using them within a Graph Convolutional Network. The improvement in classification accuracy is maximized by graphs that capture sample similarity with relatively low edge density. We show that such feature-derived graphs increase the alignment of the data to the ground truth while improving class separation. We also demonstrate that the graphs can be made more efficient using spectral sparsification, which reduces the number of edges while still improving classification performance. We illustrate our findings using synthetic and real-world datasets from various scientific domains.","tags":[],"title":"Geometric graphs from data to aid classification tasks with graph convolutional networks","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Yifan Qian","Paul Expert","Tom Rieu","Pietro Panzarasa","Mauricio Barahona"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1610323200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1610323200,"objectID":"05e854eadb2359f064fc6057062ddda4","permalink":"https://yifanqian.com/publication/qian-2021-quantifying/","publishdate":"2020-11-26T17:43:20Z","relpermalink":"/publication/qian-2021-quantifying/","section":"publication","summary":"We show that the classification performance of Graph Convolutional Networks is related to the alignment between features, graph and ground truth, which we quantify using a subspace alignment measure corresponding to the Frobenius norm of the matrix of pairwise chordal distances between three subspaces associated with features, graph and ground truth.

Thus, it is interesting to identify the relative status of journal and conference publications in different subfields of computer science based on the citation rates categorised by the China Computer Federation (CCF) classifications and venue types. In this research, we construct a dataset containing over 100,000 papers recommended by the CCF catalogue and their citation information. We also investigate some other factors that often influence a paper’s citation rate. An experimental study shows that the relative status of journals and conferences varies greatly in different subfields of computer science, and the impact of different publication levels varies according to the citation rate. We also verify that the classification of a publication, number of authors, maximum h-index of all authors of a paper, and average number of papers published by a publication have different effects on the citation rate, although the citation rate may have a different degree of correlation with these factors.","tags":[],"title":"Citation regression analysis of computer science publications in different ranking categories and subfields","type":"publication"}]
