However, focusing only on the structure of mobility networks does not provide a comprehensive view of the centrality of places in sustaining scientific production. Since mobility flows are constructed to simply reflect movements of people between geographical places, mobility networks may lead to underestimating the actual social diversity and value that places can extract, beyond these movements, from their inhabitants' social networks. Indeed mobility is inherently intertwined with social ties. For example, prior collaboration with co-authors might partly explain subsequent movements to the co-authors' cities. In this sense, the diversity of cities brought about by mobility fluxes can in fact be seen as resulting from the diversity of collaborations. Indeed, a city may thrive not simply because it attracts scientists from other cities, but also as a result of the collaborative links that the scientists living in the city have with scientists in other places. To assess and rank the importance of cities for scientific production, it is therefore essential to account for both mobility and collaboration.","tags":["Geo-social Network","Social Diversity"],"title":"Measuring the Social Diversity of Cities in Mobility and Scientific Collaboration Networks","type":"talk"},{"authors":["Yifan Qian"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1551441000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"zh","lastmod":1556455963,"objectID":"5c16e9c8acb51d919c67542d455196f6","permalink":"https://haczqyf.github.io/zh/talk/datanatives_2019_gcn/","publishdate":"2019-03-01T11:50:00Z","relpermalink":"/zh/talk/datanatives_2019_gcn/","section":"talk","summary":"","tags":["Graph Neural Network","Deep Learning"],"title":"Linking the classification performance of Graph Convolutional Networks","type":"talk"},{"authors":["Yifan Qian"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1540566300,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"zh","lastmod":1556455963,"objectID":"4d02ad6fca413adf90507dfc3258b942","permalink":"https://haczqyf.github.io/zh/talk/uknetsciworkshop_2018_gcn/","publishdate":"2018-10-26T15:05:00Z","relpermalink":"/zh/talk/uknetsciworkshop_2018_gcn/","section":"talk","summary":"","tags":["Graph Neural Network","Deep Learning"],"title":"Linking the classification performance of Graph Convolutional Networks","type":"talk"},{"authors":["Yifan Qian","Paul Expert","Pietro Panzarasa","Mauricio Barahona"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1531522800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"zh","lastmod":1556455963,"objectID":"3d76a0edeca7953ff4eb0d1d4bf3cc1d","permalink":"https://haczqyf.github.io/zh/publication/qian-2018-iccss/","publishdate":"2018-07-14T00:00:00+01:00","relpermalink":"/zh/publication/qian-2018-iccss/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Geometric deep learning and node classification: An application of Graph Convolutional Networks to citation networks","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Yifan Qian","Paul Expert","Pietro Panzarasa","Mauricio Barahona"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1529017200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"zh","lastmod":1556455963,"objectID":"c21f50dc3707b0be6ffeef3a418d3bf5","permalink":"https://haczqyf.github.io/zh/publication/qian-2018-netsci/","publishdate":"2018-06-15T00:00:00+01:00","relpermalink":"/zh/publication/qian-2018-netsci/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Geometric deep learning and node classification: An application of Graph Convolutional Networks to citation networks","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Yifan Qian"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1528794000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"zh","lastmod":1556455963,"objectID":"a3fa96dbfde61ee6b40a21da343b439e","permalink":"https://haczqyf.github.io/zh/talk/netsci_mlns_2018_gcn/","publishdate":"2018-06-12T09:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/zh/talk/netsci_mlns_2018_gcn/","section":"talk","summary":"","tags":["Graph Neural Network","Deep Learning"],"title":"Linking the classification performance of Graph Convolutional Networks","type":"talk"},{"authors":["Yifan Qian","Paul Expert","Pietro Panzarasa","Mauricio Barahona"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1528758000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"zh","lastmod":1556455963,"objectID":"b37713a5b2b9e88d4714c9d0b6f4ec6c","permalink":"https://haczqyf.github.io/zh/publication/qian-2018-netscimlns/","publishdate":"2018-06-12T00:00:00+01:00","relpermalink":"/zh/publication/qian-2018-netscimlns/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Geometric deep learning with graphs: Linking the classification performance of Graph Convolutional Networks with the alignment of graphs and features","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Yifan Qian","Wenge Rong","Nan Jiang","Jie Tang","Zhang Xiong"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1488326400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"zh","lastmod":1556455963,"objectID":"d78dbd9f92212105c67ff5a7437208cf","permalink":"https://haczqyf.github.io/zh/publication/qian2017citation/","publishdate":"2017-03-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/zh/publication/qian2017citation/","section":"publication","summary":"A number of bibliometric studies point out that the role of conference publications in computer science differs from that in other traditional fields. Thus, it is interesting to identify the relative status of journal and conference publications in different subfields of computer science based on the citation rates categorised by the China Computer Federation (CCF) classifications and venue types. In this research, we construct a dataset containing over 100,000 papers recommended by the CCF catalogue and their citation information. We also investigate some other factors that often influence a paper's citation rate. An experimental study shows that the relative status of journals and conferences varies greatly in different subfields of computer science, and the impact of different publication levels varies according to the citation rate. We also verify that the classification of a publication, number of authors, maximum h-index of all authors of a paper, and average number of papers published by a publication have different effects on the citation rate, although the citation rate may have a different degree of correlation with these factors.","tags":null,"title":"Citation regression analysis of computer science publications in different ranking categories and subfields","type":"publication"}]
